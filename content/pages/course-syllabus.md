We specified four signalings thresholds: \\(V\_{\textrm{OL}}\\) and \\(V\_{\textrm{OH}}\\) set the upper and lower bounds on voltages used to represent 0 and 1 respectively at the outputs of a combinational device. \\(V\_{\textrm{IL}}\\) and \\(V\_{\textrm{IH}}\\) served a similar role for interpreting the voltages at the inputs of a combinational device. We also specified that \\(V\_{\textrm{OL}}\\) be strictly less than \\(V\_{\textrm{IL}}\\), and termed the difference between these two low thresholds as the low noise margin, the amount of noise that could be added to an output signal and still have the signal interpreted correctly at any connected inputs. For the same reasons we specified that \\(V\_{\textrm{IH}}\\) be strictly less than \\(V\_{\textrm{OH}}\\).
